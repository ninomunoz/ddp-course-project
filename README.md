## Developing Data Products: Course Project

This github repository contains the server.R and ui.R code for my shiny application. My shiny application calculates the number of days old you are, based on the date entered by the user. 

You can access the application here: http://ninomunoz.shinyapps.io/ddp-course-project/

You can access my R presentation here: http://rpubs.com/ninomunoz/ddp-course-project
